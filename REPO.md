# Project Report

Lessons Learned: <br/>
- Learned that there is a difference between raw git hooks and the pre-commit framework
- Raw git hooks wound up being much more straightforward for us to implement and sort out locally in all operating environments

Activities: <br/>
- Initially went on a learning path trying to understand the pre-commit python package and how to set that up for our repository hook
